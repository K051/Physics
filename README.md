# Quantum Confuned Starc Effect
Quantum Confined Stark Effect is the change in quantized energy in a quantum well under the influence of an electric field which is applied across the quantum well. QCSE in superlattice is a phenomenon in which the inclination of the entire superlattice is observed. Also to note that when no Electric Field is applied, the energy levels in each well has an interference due to other wells and thus the number of bound states increases as many number of folds as there are total number of wells in the superlattice. Due to the bending of energy levels of potential well, now even the electron with lower energy than conduction band can tunnel into the well with the help of external optical energy. This effect reduces the permitted light absorption and emission frequencies. The quantum-confined Stark effect has found application in the field of solar cells, electro-absorption modeluators, and light-emitting devices. Recent experiments by Weiss et al. on semiconductor quantum dots have shown that the QCSE can also be enhanced by the presence of heterojunctions. The QCSE has been investigated using various theoretical techniques including configuration interaction method, perturbation theory and variational techniques. This report features solving of QCSE using Aestimo solver on Google Colab platform.
